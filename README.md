# Todo list front-end app with React JS  

This is a simple Todo App built using React.  
My individual coding project.

## Installation

You can use the project on Netlify: https://katereshko-react-to-do-list.netlify.app/  
Or, in the project directory, you can run:  

`npm start`  

Runs the app in the development mode.\  

## File structure  

The public directory contains files that will be read by your browser while you're developing the app; the most important of these is index.html. React injects your code into this file so that your browser can run it. 

src directory - contains all the following files and folders  

assets directory - contains the main styles file App.css and the 'Pictures' folder (it contains all background pictures' files)    
App.css - main styles file
Pictures directory - contains all pictures' files  

components directory - contains all React components  
App.js - the main component  
Header.js - contains the main header  
ToDoList.js - contains the todo list block itself with its logic
License.js - contains the bottom where the pictures' license is mentioned  
Pictures.js - contains the background images  

## User side  

In order to use the app, open it via Netlify using the link in the very beginning  
To add a new item to the list, type the text in the input field and press Enter key / click the "Add" button  
When the task is done, click on the relevant item, and it will be crossed (or click it again in order to withdrow the crossing).  
When the todo list is not needed anymore, press the "Delete" button, and the list will be cleared.  
Right after that you can use the toolm again and create a new todo list.  

## Logic side
