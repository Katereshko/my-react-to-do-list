# Todo list front-end app with React JS  

This is a simple Todo App built using React.  
My individual coding project.

## Installation

You can use the project on Netlify: https://katereshko-react-to-do-list.netlify.app/  
Or, in the project directory, you can run:  

`npm start`  

Runs the app in the development mode.\  

## File structure  

The public directory contains files that will be read by your browser while you're developing the app; the most important of these is index.html. React injects your code into this file so that your browser can run it. 

'src' folder - contains all the following files and folders   
'assets' folder - contains the main styles file App.css and the 'Pictures' folder (it contains all background pictures' files)  
'components' folder - contains all React components  
App.js - the main component  
Header.js - contains the main header  
ToDoList.js - contains the todo list block itself with its logic
License.js - contains the bottom where the pictures' license is mentioned  
Pictures.js - contains the background images


index.html - main html file - to play the game, open this file on browser window  
Let's open src/index.js, because that's where the App component is being used. This file is the entry point for our app, and it initially looks like this

style.css - main styling file
favicon.ico - icon to be displayed on browser tab
'eyes' folder - SVG files which create animation effect
